# TerrainGen
A very simple terrain generator and visualizer using C++ and OpenGL. The project files were build for Visual Studio, 
I don't have the debug libs in the project currently, if building please build for release.

Controls:
Mouse = Moving the mouse will move the camera facing

w = move forward
s = move backward
